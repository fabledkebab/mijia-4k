## MiJia 4K camera research
The main information is written in the README file!

### YUV Player
First of all, now we are 100% sure that the camera's OS is Linux.  
And I found some interesting file in a hidden folder (MISC) in camera's SD, the file's name is "player.yuv".  
Smells like some YUV Player stuff.  

### Thumb Data
Now this is interesting. This file contains some C/C++ code and many other text and code.  
People say that this is a thumbnail file in Android. I have formatted the SD card many times and the file size
didn't change.
